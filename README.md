### Abstract

Climate change is an existential threat facing humanity and the future of our planet. The
signs of global warming are everywhere, and they are more complex than just the climbing
temperatures. Climate data on a massive scale has been collected by various scientific groups
around the globe. Exploring and extracting useful knowledge from large quantities of data
requires powerful software. In this chapter we present some possibilities for exploring and
visualising climate change data in connection with statistics education using the freely
accessible statistical programming language _R_ togetherwith the computing environment
_RStudio_. In addition to the visualisations, we provideannotated references to climate data
repositories and extracts of our openly published R scripts for encouraging teachers and
students to reproduce and enhance the visualisations.

## The Book: Statistics for empowerment and social engagement: teaching Civic Statistics to develop informed citizens 


J. Ridgway (Ed.). (2022). Statistics for empowerment and social engagement:
teaching Civic Statistics to develop informed citizens. Springer.

Effective citizen engagement with social issues requires active participation and a broad
understanding of data and statistics about societal issues. However, many statistics curricula are
not designed to teach relevant skills nor to improve learners' statistical literacy.
This book offers practical approaches to working in a new field of knowledge - Civic Statistics -
which sets out to engage with, and overcome well documented and long-standing problems in
teaching quantitative skills. The book includes 23 peer-reviewed chapters, written in coordination
by an international group of experts from ten countries. The book aims to support and enhance the
work of teachers and lecturers working both at the high school and tertiary (university) levels. It is
designed to promote and improve the critical understanding of quantitative evidence relevant to
burning social issues – such as epidemics, climate change, poverty, migration, natural disasters,
inequality, employment, and racism.
Evidence about social issues is provided to the public via print and digital media, official statistics
offices, and other information channels, and a great deal of data is accessible both as aggregated
summaries and as individual records. Chapters illustrate the approaches needed to teach and
promote the knowledge, skills, dispositions, and enabling processes associated with critical
understanding of Civic Statistics presented in many forms. These include statistical analysis of
authentic multivariate data, use of dynamic data visualisations, and deconstructing texts about the
social and economic well-being of societies and communities. Chapters discuss ideas regarding the
development of curricula and educational resources, use of emerging technologies and
visualizations, preparation of teachers and teaching approaches and sources for relevant datasets
and rich texts about Civic Statistics, and ideas regarding future research, assessment,
collaborations between different stakeholders, and other systemic issues.
